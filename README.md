# Staying in Tonight

## Description
This webpage serves as a tool to help user's decide how to spend a night staying at home, by either watching a movie or playing a video game. The user chooses a selection whether they are in the mood to watch a movie or play a game. They then choose what they are in the mood for, such as "Happy", "Sad", etc. After they choose their mood, a poster of a random game/movie will appear below the buttons, featuring a brief overview of the media.
